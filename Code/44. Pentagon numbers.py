'''
    Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, P_n=n(3nâˆ’1)/2. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:
    1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...
    It can be seen that P_4 + P_7 = 22 + 70 = 92 = P_8. However, their difference, 70 - 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.
    Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, P_j and P_k, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and D = |P_k - P_j| is minimised; what is the value of D?
